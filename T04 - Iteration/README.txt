# Task 4 - Iteration

Welcome to Task 4 of the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp!

## Overview

This folder contains Python scripts related to the concept of iteration. The scripts demonstrate how to handle user input using while loops and calculate averages based on the input provided by the user.

## Scripts

### `while.py`

#### Description

This Python script continuously asks the user to enter numbers until `-1` is entered. It then calculates and prints the average of the entered numbers, excluding `-1`.

#### Usage

To use `while.py`:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts to enter numbers. Enter `-1` to stop input and calculate the average.

#### Features

- Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs.
- The script efficiently computes the average using basic arithmetic operations.

#### Notes

- This script is part of the practical exercises from the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp.

### `pattern.py`

#### Description

This Python script prints a specific pattern using a single for loop and if-else statements. The pattern alternates increasing and decreasing lines of asterisks (`*`).

#### Usage

To use `pattern.py`:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Observe the pattern printed to the console.

#### Features

- Demonstrates control flow using a single for loop and if-else statements.
- Prints a symmetrical pattern with increasing and decreasing lines of asterisks.

#### Notes

- This script is part of the practical exercises from the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp.
