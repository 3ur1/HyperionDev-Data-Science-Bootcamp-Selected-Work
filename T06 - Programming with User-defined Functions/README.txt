## Overview

This Python script, `holiday.py`, is designed to assist users in calculating the total cost of their holiday. It incorporates specific functions to handle calculations for flight, hotel stay, and car rental costs based on user-provided inputs. By utilizing simple input prompts and conditional logic, the script efficiently computes and displays the comprehensive expense breakdown for the user's holiday.

## Usage

1. **Input Requirements**:
- `city_flight`: Users are prompted to enter '1' for Madagascar, '2' for Italy, or '3' for China to choose their destination city for the flight.
- `num_nights`: Users input the number of nights they plan to stay at the hotel.
- `rental_days`: Users specify the number of days they intend to rent a car during their holiday.

2. **Running the Script**:
- To use the script, execute `holiday.py` within a Python environment.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to input the required values for city_flight, num_nights, and rental_days.
- Upon receiving the inputs, the script calculates the total holiday cost and displays it to the user.

3. **Example**:
- For instance, if a user selects Madagascar (city_flight = 1), plans to stay for 7 nights at the hotel (num_nights = 7), and rents a car for 5 days (rental_days = 5), the script will output:
  ```
  To fly to Madagascar type '1', to fly to Italy, type '2', or to fly to China type '3': 1
  Enter the number of nights you plan to stay: 7
  Enter the number of days for car rental: 5
  Total holiday cost: Â£5050
  ```
